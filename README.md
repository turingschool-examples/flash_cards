## Flash Cards

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is Joseph Samere's [Flash Cards](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/flashcards) project.

> [!NOTE]  
> There are two commits for this project, first the original project and the regular requirements; and the second commit will be the more fun version where I learn new things in ruby and attempt to build upon this.

> [!TIP]
> I have labeled almost everything in runner saying what it does for my sake so I don't forget by tomorrow; wasnt sure if you wanted this info but it is there.
